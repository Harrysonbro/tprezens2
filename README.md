# Mr. Prezens

Hello all!
Welcome to my [St Andrews College](https://www.sac.on.ca/) profile.

Here you will find our class repositories for:
- TEJ3M - Computer Engineering

Also we will be using collaborative repositories to:
- [x] share code
- [x] share class resources
- [ ] collaborate

> [!NOTE]
> This profile is simply an example of what you can make

## How to make your own profile
You can make your own profile README.md file from your home dashboard at [GitHub](https://github.com/)

Click on the "Create Profile ReadMe"

You will then be taken to the screen that looks like this to create your profile using markdown formatting.

You can find information about markdown formatting in github [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#images).

You can preview your page using the "Preview" button.

When you are done and ready to submit, you can hit the "Commit" button. 

> [!WARNING]
> Your profile is visible to all by default, and represents you professionally. Please ensure you are representing yourself and the school well.

## Markup Languages
A *markup language* is a way of writing code that a computer understands and can use to render data (usually text). The most common markup language is *HTML* or Hyper Text Markup Language. Markdown (this language)
and LaTeX are other common mark-down languages. All text editors fall into two categories
- Markup (You write commands that the computer interprets into formatted text)
- WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get, like Word or GoogleDocs)
 
## Task
- [ ] Create your own profile/README.md file telling the world a bit about yourself
- [ ] Use the Markdown reference linked above to write your description
- [ ] Include at least one: heading, link, image, list in your profile
